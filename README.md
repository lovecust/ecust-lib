# Lovecust Library

> Created by Fisher at 16:27 on 2016-01-07.

Lovecust-Library is a tool providing Ecust-Library 'real time' (1 minutes delay) status and it is distributed at [http://lib.lovecust.com/][website-lib-lovecust-com].

## WHY

#### Accessing Library Status Wherever and Whenever

We want to see how many students are in each floor of Ecust Library and it is a trouble to open WeChat and find '小花梨' to get the data we need sometimes. With Lovecust-Library you always have the access to the library status in real time(maximum 1 minutes delay to be more specific) once you are online.

[//]: # (#### More than Current Status)

[//]: # (You can analyze the data of Ecust Library.)
